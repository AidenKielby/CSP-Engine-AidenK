# Available constraint types:
# - equal:         All listed variables must have the same value
# - not_equal:     All listed variables must have different values
# - value_in:      Variable must be one of a specific list of values
# - value_not_in:  Variable must NOT be one of a specific list
#
# Arithmetic constraints (use with a comparison type):
# - sum:           Sum of variables
# - product:       Product of variables
# - difference:    Absolute or directional difference
# - modulo:        Remainder of division
#
# Comparison types (used with arithmetic constraints):
# - equal
# - greater_than
# - less_than
#
# Modifier ('modifier'): a number added to the constraint output (CAN NOT be negative).
#
# Fairness Objective ('fairnessObjective') has two options:
# - 'balance', minimizing the difference between the variables
# - 'ignore', ignores the Fairness Objective and acts as a normal CSP
#
# Example Variable declaration:
# variables:
#   A1: [0, 1, 2, 3]
#
# Example constraint:
# - type: sum
#   vars: [A, B]
#   comparison: equal
#   value: 5
#   modifier: 0
